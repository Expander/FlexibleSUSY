FlexibleSUSY-0.5.4 [not released yet]

 * Bugfix (commit 399a1c8): renaming SoftsusyMSSM and SoftsusyNMSSM
   model classes and files to make `make all-test' work on HFS (fixes
   #2).

 * Bugfix (commit cfc2562): correcting MS-bar to DR-bar conversion of
   fermion masses mb and mtau.

 * Bugfix (commit ceecc4a): fixing compilation error with Intel icpc
   14.0, Build 20130728 (and GNU STL 4.6.4 and 4.8.1).

 * Bugfix (commit db60205): fixing linking error of
   test/test_MSSM_NMSSM_linking.x in case LoopTools is used.

 * Bugfix (commit 32c3222): generalizing color summation routine to
   handle single-generation fields and non-fundamental
   representations.

 * Bugfix (commit 3fd2699): Correcting the determination of the number
   of EWSB eqs. in case of CP violating models.

 * Set minimum required SARAH version to 4.0.4, because it implements
   the full two-loop VEV beta functions from arXiv:1310.7629 .

 * Add stand-alone examples to illustrate how to use FlexibleSUSY's
   classes and libraries independently of FlexibleSUSY's build system.

 * Add tower example to illustrate how to glue multiple models to form
   a stack of effective field theories.

 * Implement leading two-loop MSSM and NMSSM tadpoles from Slavich
   (used in the EWSB conditions).

 * Implement leading two-loop MSSM and NMSSM CP-even and CP-odd Higgs
   self-energy contributions from Slavich.

 * Allow to constrain the boundary condition scale via the model file
   variables {Low,SUSY,High}ScaleMinimum and
   {Low,SUSY,High}ScaleMaximum.

 * Allow explicite setting (and disabling) of the Yukawa couplings in
   the constraints.

 * Enable/disable multi-threading at the configure level

 * lower required g++ version to 4.4.7

 * Enable source code export without the meta code via `make
   install-src'.

 * Add FFLite module as a thread-safe alternative to LoopTools

 * Create helper function to find the LSP.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5.3 [January, 21 2014]

 * Bugfix (commit 44903c): correcting malformed print out in
   config/list_sarah_model_files.sh in case model files do not exist

 * Bugfix (commit 3aae11): Prevent hard-coding of the running Weinberg
   angle in terms of the gauge couplings

 * Bugfix (commit ce4a73): Generalize calculation of gauge couplings
   at the low-scale (fixes #1)

 * Vertices are saved in a file to avoid repeating same calculation.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5.2 [January 14, 2014]

 * Bugfix (commit 58f8f9): Convert beta functions which are identical
   zero to the data type of the corresponding parameter.

 * Bugfix (commit e5f937): Correcting check of SARAH patch level
   against minimum required patch level.

 * Bugfix (commit e2d43b): Adapting free phases of fermion fields if
   mass is less than zero.

 * Bugfix (commit e777e1): Converting indices to C convention in
   tree-level EWSB equations.

 * Set minimum required SARAH version to 4.0.3, because it includes a
   bug fix in the index structure of the charged Higgs self-energies.

 * Allow setting of single matrix/ vector elements in the constraints.

 * Model files are now in the directory model_files/
   (instead of templates/)

 * The command line arguments of the createmodel script changed.
   Please see ./createmodel --help for more details.

 * Add support for the LHInput[p] command in constraints, which reads
   the parameter `p' from the SLHA input file.

 * Constrain time used to simplify the beta functions (default: 120
   seconds per beta function).  To change the time constraint, set
   FlexibleSUSY`FSSimplifyBetaFunctionsTimeConstraint .

 * Avoid swapping by distributing the calculation of the two-scale
   beta functions among multiple .cpp files.

 * Introduce separate meta code stamp (triggers running of the meta
   code) with name models/<model-name>/00_DELETE_ME_TO_RERUN_METACODE

FlexibleSUSY-0.5.1 [November 23, 2013]

 * Handle parameters of type vector in the beta functions.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5 [November 18, 2013]

 * Store particle masses as Eigen::Array and mixing matrices as
   Eigen::Matrix.
