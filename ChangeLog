FlexibleSUSY-0.5.2 [not released yet]

 * Bugfix (commit 58f8f9): Convert beta functions which are identical
   zero to the data type of the corresponding parameter.

 * Bugfix (commit e5f937): Correcting check of SARAH patch level
   against minimum required patch level.

 * Set minimum required SARAH version to 4.0.3, because it includes a
   bug fix in the index structure of the charged Higgs self-energies.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5.1 [November 23, 2013]

 * Handle parameters of type vector in the beta functions.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5 [November 18, 2013]

 * Store particle masses as Eigen::Array and mixing matrices as
   Eigen::Matrix.
