FlexibleSUSY-1.0.5 [not released yet]

 * Feature: Calculation of DR-bar weak mixing angle from Fermi
   constant and Z pole mass.  The implementation is based on
   expressions from SoftSUSY and works for the SM, MSSM, NMSSM and
   their variants.  The method for the calculation of the weak mixing
   angle can be selected via the FSWeakMixingAngleInput variable in
   the FlexibleSUSY model file.
   Example:
   FSWeakMixingAngleInput = FSFermiConstant; (* or FSMassW *)
   Note: To achieve the maximum accuracy available, set the threshold
   corrections loop order to 2 (FlexibleSUSY block entry 7)

 * Bugfix (commit 4a1c471): ensure that the lightest CP-odd Higgs mass
   is used in the two-loop Higgs self-energy and tadpole corrections.
   Before, there were cases where a Goldstone boson mass was used.

 * Bugfix (commit 8335640): ensure that the tree-level EWSB conditions
   are fulfilled during calculation of the tree-level spectrum in
   non-SUSY models.

 * Bugfix (commit 29a0833): incorporate tadpole contributions in pole
   masses of singlets

 * Bugfix (commit 3422d88): ensure only gluon is removed from top
   self-energy for calculation of top DR-bar mass in the SM

 * Bugfix (commits 66d38f4 and 4ed231d): ensure Higgs and Goldstone
   boson contributions are contained in the bottom and tau
   self-energies for calculation of bottom and tau DR-bar masses in
   the SM

FlexibleSUSY-1.0.4 [January, 15 2015]

 * Add new user example program run_cmd_line_<model>.x to run a
   parameter point using command line parameters instead of an SLHA
   input file.

 * Allow input parameters in first guesses of scale definitions, for
   example
   SUSYScaleFirstGuess = Sqrt[Sqrt[LHInput[mq2[3,3]] * LHInput[mu2[3,3]]]]

 * Adding support for FlexibleSUSY addons.  They are placed inside the
   addons/ directory and can be configued and compiled via
   ./configure --with-addons=<addon> && make

 * Adding EWSB solvers using a fixed-point iteration (FPIRelative,
   FPIAbsolute, FPITadpole).  FPIRelative is now the first default
   solver used.  Thanks to Dylan Harries.

 * Adding new NMSSM model file `NUTNMSSM' with non-universal soft
   Higgs masses (EWSB output) and non-universal trilinear couplings
   A_lambda and A_kappa at MX.

 * Read user input W boson pole mass form SMINPUTS block entry 9.

 * Read user input Z boson pole mass from SMINPUTS block entry 4.

 * Automatic check for non-perturbative dimensionless model parameters
   at the high-scale.  The check can be disabled by stetting
   FSCheckPerturbativityOfDimensionlessParameters = False;
   in the model file.  The threshold can be set via the
   FSPerturbativityThreshold variable.  The default threshold is
   N[Sqrt[4 Pi]] = 3.54491.
