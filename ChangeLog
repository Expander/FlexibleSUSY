   in the src module.

   spectrum.

 * Set minimum required SARAH version to 4.0.4, because it implements
   the full two-loop VEV beta functions from arXiv:1310.7629 .

 * Add stand-alone examples to illustrate how to use FlexibleSUSY's
   classes and libraries independently of FlexibleSUSY's build system.

 * Add tower example to illustrate how to glue multiple models to form
   a stack of effective field theories.

   auto-generated C++ component by something of an alternative origin.

   self-energy contributions from Slavich.

 * Allow to constrain the boundary condition scale via the model file
   variables {Low,SUSY,High}ScaleMinimum and
   {Low,SUSY,High}ScaleMaximum.

   the constraints.

 * Enable/disable multi-threading at the configure level

 * lower required g++ version to 4.4.7

 * Enable source code export without the meta code via `make
   install-src'.

   mass is less than zero.

   bug fix in the index structure of the charged Higgs self-energies.

 * Allow setting of single matrix/ vector elements in the constraints.

 * Model files are now in the directory model_files/
   (instead of templates/)

 * The command line arguments of the createmodel script changed.
   Please see ./createmodel --help for more details.

 * Add support for the LHInput[p] command in constraints, which reads
   the parameter `p' from the SLHA input file.

 * Constrain time used to simplify the beta functions (default: 120
   seconds per beta function).  To change the time constraint, set
   FlexibleSUSY`FSSimplifyBetaFunctionsTimeConstraint .

 * Avoid swapping by distributing the calculation of the two-scale
   beta functions among multiple .cpp files.

 * Introduce separate meta code stamp (triggers running of the meta
   code) with name models/<model-name>/00_DELETE_ME_TO_RERUN_METACODE
