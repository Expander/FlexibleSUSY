Building FlexibleSUSY
=====================

Requirements
------------

* C++ compiler (g++ >= 4.8.4 or clang++ >= 3.8.1 or icpc >= 15.0.0)
* Fortran compiler (gfortran, ifort)
* Mathematica (version 7.0 or higher)
* SARAH_ (version 4.11.0 or higher)
* Boost_ (version 1.37.0 or higher)
* `Eigen 3`_ (version 3.1 or higher)
* `GNU scientific library`_

Optional:

* BLAS_
* LAPACK_
* FeynArts_ (version 3.9 or higher)
* FormCalc_ (version 9.5 or higher)
* LoopTools_ (version 2.8 or higher)
* Himalaya_


Installation of SARAH
---------------------

FlexibleSUSY requires SARAH to be installed and to be loadable with
the ``Needs["SARAH`"]`` command from inside Mathematica.  We recommend
the following setup::

    SARAH_VERSION=4.14.0
    cd ~/.Mathematica/Applications/
    wget https://sarah.hepforge.org/downloads/SARAH-${SARAH_VERSION}.tar.gz
    tar -xf SARAH-${SARAH_VERSION}.tar.gz
    ln -s ${PWD}/SARAH-${SARAH_VERSION}/ SARAH

    cd ~/.Mathematica/Kernel/
    echo "AppendTo[\$Path, \"${HOME}/.Mathematica/Applications/SARAH/\"];" >> init.m

All the above steps can be executed at once with the ``install-sarah``
script::

    ./install-sarah

See ``./install-sarah --help`` for more options.

Installation of FeynArts/FormCalc/LoopTools
-------------------------------------------

If you want FlexibleSUSY to use either FeynArts, FormCalc or LoopTools
you will need to install these packages first.  Also - as with SARAH -
they need to be loadable with the ``Needs[]`` command from inside
Mathematica.  We recommend using the installation script `FeynInstall`
provided on the FeynArts web page. e.g:

    cd ~/.local
    wget http://www.feynarts.de/FeynInstall
    chmod 755 FeynInstall
    ./FeynInstall

which will install the latest versions of FeynArts, FormCalc and
LoopTools in the `~/.local/` directory as well as configure Mathematica
to find these packages.  Note that running the `FeynInstall` script
might require user intervention.

Building a FlexibleSUSY model
-----------------------------

0. Before you setup a FlexibleSUSY model, you have to provide a SARAH
   model file.  To make it available in FlexibleSUSY, you can put it
   either into FlexibleSUSY's SARAH model directory
   ``FlexibleSUSY/sarah/<model>/`` or directly into SARAH's own model
   directly ``SARAH/Models/<model>/``.  Here ``<model>`` is the name
   of your model (e.g. MSSM, NMSSM, etc.).  Note, that there are
   already plenty of pre-installed model files in FlexibleSUSY's and
   SARAH's model directories that can be used.

1. Create a new or re-initialize an existing FlexibleSUSY model::

       ./createmodel --name=<model>

   See ``./createmodel --help`` for more details.  Afterwards there will
   be

   * a model directory ``models/<model>/``
   * a makefile module ``models/<model>/module.mk``
   * a Mathematica start script ``models/<model>/start.m``
   * and a FlexibleSUSY model file ``models/<model>/FlexibleSUSY.m``

   To modify the model details (input parameters, boundary conditions,
   etc.), edit the FlexibleSUSY model file
   ``models/<model>/FlexibleSUSY.m``.  For more details see the
   documentation of the `FlexibleSUSY model file`_ and
   `FlexibleEFTHiggs`_.

2. Create the Makefile and register your model(s)::

       ./configure --with-models=<model>

   Multiple models can be specified, separated by a comma.  See
   ``./configure --help`` for more options.

3. Compile FlexibleSUSY with your model::

       make

   Use ``make -j<N>`` to use ``<N>`` CPU cores.  When ``make`` is
   executed, Mathematica is called, which generates the C++ code for
   the specified models.  All C++ source files are written to the
   directory ``models/<model>/``.  When ``make`` has finished, the C++
   code is compiled and the following spectrum generators are created
   for each specified model:

   * ``models/<model>/run_<model>.x``: command line spectrum generator
   * ``models/<model>/run_<model>.m``: Mathematica interface

Example::

    ./createmodel --name=HSSUSY
    ./configure --with-models=HSSUSY
    make -j4

    ./models/HSSUSY/run_HSSUSY.x --slha-input-file=model_files/HSSUSY/LesHouches.in.HSSUSY


Using FlexibleSUSY
==================

Available models
----------------

FlexibleSUSY ships with many pre-generated models.  The following
table includes an (incomplete) list of models with a detailed
documentation.

======================== ====================================
 Model                    Description
======================== ====================================
 `HSSUSY`_                high-scale MSSM (pure EFT)
 `MSSMEFTHiggs`_          high-scale MSSM (FlexibleEFTHiggs)
 `NUHMSSMNoFVHimalaya`_   fixed-order MSSM
======================== ====================================

.. _`HSSUSY`: doc/HSSUSY.rst
.. _`MSSMEFTHiggs`: doc/MSSMEFTHiggs.rst
.. _`NUHMSSMNoFVHimalaya`: doc/NUHMSSMNoFVHimalaya.rst


Command line
------------

For each model FlexibleSUSY creates an executable
``models/<model>/run_<model>.x`` that can be run from the command
line.  The executable accepts the input in the SLHA format, for
example in form of a file::

    ./models/MSSM/run_MSSM.x \
       --slha-input-file=models/MSSM/LesHouches.in.MSSM \
       --slha-output-file=LesHouches.out.MSSM

or as a stream::

    cat models/MSSM/LesHouches.in.MSSM \
       | ./models/MSSM/run_MSSM.x --slha-input-file=- --slha-output-file=LesHouches.out.MSSM

For a documentation of FlexibleSUSY-specific switches in the SLHA
input see the section on `SLHA input parameters`_.

By default the executable writes the output in SLHA format to stdout.
The output can also be appended to an SQLite database::

    ./models/MSSM/run_MSSM.x \
       --slha-input-file=models/MSSM/LesHouches.in.MSSM \
       --slha-output-file=LesHouches.out.MSSM \
       --database-output-file=points.db

See ``models/<model>/run_<model>.x --help`` for further options.


Mass spectrum and renormalization group running
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The pole mass spectrum and the RG flow can be written to text files
for easy plotting.  In the MSSM for example these text files can be
generated via::

    ./models/MSSM/run_MSSM.x \
       --slha-input-file=model_files/MSSM/LesHouches.in.MSSM \
       --rgflow-output-file=MSSM_rgflow.dat \
       --spectrum-output-file=MSSM_spectrum.dat

The generated files ``MSSM_rgflow.dat`` and ``MSSM_spectrum.dat`` can
be plotted for example with the gnuplot scripts in the model
directory::

    gnuplot -persist -e "filename='MSSM_spectrum.dat'" \
       models/MSSM/MSSM_plot_spectrum.gnuplot

    gnuplot -persist -e "filename='MSSM_rgflow.dat'" \
       models/MSSM/MSSM_plot_rgflow.gnuplot

The gnuplot scripts are just for illustration and currently plot all
running parameters, regardless of their mass dimension, so the
resulting plot is not particularly informative.  However, one may
easily adapt the scripts to plot any chosen subset of the parameters.


Mathematica interface
---------------------

FlexibleSUSY can be called from within Mathematica using Wolfram's
LibraryLink.  By default, FlexibleSUSY creates a LibraryLink library
for each spectrum genreator.  The generated library can be found in
``models/<model>/<model>_librarylink.so``, where ``<model>`` is the
model name.

Example::

    Get["models/CMSSM/CMSSM_librarylink.m"];
    
    (* Create a handle to a model given the input parameters.
       See Options[FSCMSSMOpenHandle] for all default options. *)
    handle = FSCMSSMOpenHandle[
      fsSettings -> { precisionGoal -> 1.*^-4 },
      fsSMParameters -> { Mt -> 173.3 },
      fsModelParameters -> {
          m0 -> 125, m12 -> 500, TanBeta -> 10, SignMu -> 1, Azero -> 0 }
    ];
    
    (* calculate pole mass spectrum *)
    FSCMSSMCalculateSpectrum[handle]
    
    (* calculate observables *)
    FSCMSSMCalculateObservables[handle]
    
    (* close the model handle *)
    FSCMSSMCloseHandle[handle];

For each model, FlexibleSUSY creates an example Mathematica script
which illustrates the use of the Mathematica interface.  The generated
example can be found in ``models/<model>/run_<model>.m`` which can be
run for example as::

    math -run "<< \"models/<model>/run_<model>.m\""

Before running it, the model parameters in the script should be set to
reasonable values.  More advanced examples can be found in the
FlexibleSUSY documentation.

Note: In order to compile the library, Mathematica must be installed.
To disable the LibraryLink interface, configure with
``--disable-librarylink``.

Further details and examples can be found in the `LibraryLink
documentation`_.

.. _`LibraryLink documentation`: doc/librarylink.rst

Parameter scans
---------------

FlexibleSUSY contains two shell scripts aiming to help the user
performing parameter scans based on SLHA files.

Tabular output
``````````````

The script ``utils/scan-slha.sh`` performs a scan over an input
parameter.

Examples:

To perform a scan over :math:`\tan\beta(M_Z)` in the CMSSM (given in
the SLHA input file in the ``MINPAR[3]`` field) and print out the the
values of :math:`\tan\beta(M_Z)`, :math:`M_h` (``MASS[25]``) and
:math:`y_t(M_{\text{SUSY}})` (``YU[2,2]``) run::

     utils/scan-slha.sh \
        --spectrum-generator=models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
        --slha-input-file=model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
        --scan-range=MINPAR[3]=1~30:10 \
        --output=MINPAR[3],MASS[25],YU[2:2]

Alternatively, the SLHA input can be piped into the script as
::

    cat model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
       | utils/scan-slha.sh \
         --spectrum-generator=models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
         --scan-range=MINPAR[3]=1~30:10 \
         --output=MINPAR[3],MASS[25],YU[2:2]

The spectrum generator executable is specified using the
``--spectrum-generator=`` option.  The parameter to be scanned over as
well as the scan range and the number of steps must be specified using
the ``--scan-range=`` option.  The syntax is::

    --scan-range=<block>[<field>]=<start>~<stop>:<number_of_steps>

Here ``<block>`` is the SLHA block in which the input parameter is to
be found and ``<field>`` is the block entry corresponding to the
parameter.  ``<start>`` and ``<stop>`` define the scan range and
``<number_of_steps>`` define the number of steps.  By default the step
size is linear.  Alternatively, a logarithmic step size can be chosen
by passing ``--step-size=log`` to the script.  See also
``utils/scan-slha.sh --help``.  The parameters to print to the output
stream must be defined using the ``--output=`` option.  The syntax
is::

    --output=<block>[<fields>]

where ``<block>`` is the SLHA block in which the output parameter is to
be read from and ``<field>`` is the block entry corresponding to the
parameter.  To read a matrix element from a block, use a colon ``:`` to
specify the matrix element indices.  Multiple output parameters can be
specified by a comma.

Database output
```````````````

As an alternative, all parameters calculated during a scan can be
written to a SQLite database using the ``scan-database.sh`` script.

Examples::

    utils/scan-database.sh \
       --spectrum-generator=models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
       --slha-input-file=model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
       --scan-range=MINPAR[3]=1~30:10 \
       --database-output-file=scan.db

or::

    cat model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
       | ./utils/scan-database.sh \
         --spectrum-generator=models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
         --scan-range=MINPAR[3]=1~30:10 \
         --database-output-file=scan.db

The name of the database file must be set using the
``--database-output-file=`` option.

Convert SPheno to FlexibleSUSY model file
-----------------------------------------

The script ``utils/convert_SPheno_to_FlexibleSUSY.m`` can help to
convert a SPheno model file (``SPheno.m``) to a FlexibleSUSY model
file (``FlexibleSUSY.m.in``).  The conversion is not perfect, because
it is usually not unique.  Therefore one should check the generated
``FlexibleSUSY.m.in`` file.

Example::

    cat << EOF | math -noprompt > FlexibleSUSY.m.in
    sphenoFile = "~/.Mathematica/Applications/SARAH/Models/MSSM/SPheno.m";
    Get["utils/convert_SPheno_to_FlexibleSUSY.m"];
    EOF


Advanced FlexibleSUSY build options
===================================

Generating source code files only (no compilation)
----------------------------------------------------

If you want to only create the C++ source files for your model, but do
not want to compile the code, you can use the ``--disable-compile``
configure option::

    ./configure --with-models=MSSM --disable-compile
    make

Here, configure will not check for installed compilers or libraries.
It will only search for Mathematica and SARAH.  The execution of
``make`` will stop as soon as all C++ source code files are generated.
See below for how to export the generated source code.


Compile only (don't generate source code)
-----------------------------------------

If you want to only compile already created the C++ source files for
your model, you can use the ``--disable-meta`` configure option::

    ./configure --with-models=MSSM --disable-meta
    make

Here, configure will only check for installed compilers or libraries.
It will not check for Mathematica and SARAH.

This option is useful if you want to generate the source code on one
computer and then transfer the generated code to another computer to
compile it.  This option can also be used with the pre-generated
FlexibleSUSY models, which are provided at the FlexibleSUSY home page.

Warning: Please make sure all C++ source files of your model are
available in the model directory ``models/<model>/``.  Otherwise the
compilation will fail.


Exporting the generated source code
-----------------------------------

The complete FlexibleSUSY source code, including the generated C++
code for the specified model(s) (but without the Mathematica meta
code), can be exported to a new directory.  The exported source code
is a complete standalone package, with it's own build system.  To
export the code, one has to set the target directory during
configuration via the ``--with-install-dir=`` option.  For example::

    ./configure --with-models=<models> --with-install-dir=/path/to/export/directory

Afterwards
::

    make install-src

must be executed, which will copy the generated C++ source code for
all ``<models>`` to ``/path/to/export/directory``, together with the
non-model specific source code from ``config/``, ``doc/``, ``slhaea/``
and ``src/``.  Afterwards, the standalone package can be build like
this::

    cd /path/to/export/directory
    ./configure
    make

It is also possible to create a "model package", which includes only
the generated source code for a given model, but does not contain the
whole FlexibleSUSY build system.  This is useful when the source code
for a model should be generated on one computer and later transferred
to another one to be compiled.  To create such a "model package" run
::

    make pack-<model>-src

where ``<model>`` is the name of the model whose generated source code
shall be packed.  After ``make`` has finished, the package file
``<model>.tar.gz`` can be found in the working directory.


Dynamic libraries
-----------------

If you want to create dynamic model libraries (instead of static
libraries, which is the default) you need to pass the
--enable-shared-libs option to the configure script.  The file name
extension for the shared libraries as well as the command to build
them can be overwritten using the ``--with-shared-lib-ext=``
``--with-shared-lib-cmd=``.  parameters.  For example, when Intel
compilers should be used, replace gcc by icc or icpc::

    ./configure --with-models=CMSSM,NMSSM \
       --enable-shared-libs \
       --with-shared-lib-ext=".so" \
       --with-shared-lib-cmd="gcc -shared -o"

**Important remark:**

The libraries are linked to the executables with *absolute* paths.
This means that, if you for example move the FlexibleSUSY directory to
another location, the executables will no longer find the libraries.
To make the executables find the libraries again, you have to relink
them via
::

    make clean-executables
    make allexec


Statically linked executables
-----------------------------

External libraries can be linked statically to the spectrum generator
executables by passing ``--enable-static`` to configure.  This is
useful when the executable should be transferred to another computer,
where some libraries are not available.

Example::

    ./configure --with-models=CMSSM --enable-static

If ``--enable-static`` is used, the following linker flags and
additional libraries will be used::

    LDFLAGS = -static
    LDLIBS  = -ldl

These linker-specific flags and additional libraries can be
overwritten using ``--with-static-ldflags=`` and
``--with-static-ldlibs=``

Example::

    ./configure --with-models=CMSSM \
       --enable-static \
       --with-static-ldflags="-static" \
       --with-static-ldlibs="-lquadmath -ldl"

In case of dynamic linking (``--disable-static``, which is the default),
the options ``--with-shared-ldflags=`` and ``--with-shared-ldlibs=`` must
be used to set ``LDFLAGS`` and ``LDLIBS``.


LoopTools support
-----------------

It is possible to use LoopTools_ for calculating the loop functions,
instead of using SOFTSUSY's loop functions.  To enable LoopTools
configure FlexibleSUSY via ::

    ./configure --enable-looptools

To use the LoopTools library and header files from a specific
directory configure via
::

    ./configure --enable-looptools \
       --with-looptools-incdir="/path/to/looptools/build/" \
       --with-looptools-libdir="/path/to/looptools/build/"

Note: LoopTools 2.8 or higher is required.


Creating an addon
-----------------

A FlexibleSUSY addon is a program or library, which uses parts of the
FlexibleSUSY libraries or the generated models or is integrated into
FlexibleSUSY.  An example is GM2Calc_, which is included in
FlexibleSUSY in form of an addon.  An addon can be created via ::

    ./createaddon --name=<addon>

where ``<addon>`` is the name of the addon.  The createaddon script
creates the directory ``addons/<addon>/`` and the corresponding makefile
module ``addons/<addon>/module.mk``.  If an addon has been created with
the above script, the user may edit the makefile module
(``addons/<addon>/module.mk``) to add source files in to the three
variables
::

    LIB@ADDON@_SRC  # list of source files to be included in library
    EXE@ADDON@_SRC  # list of source files with a main()
    LIB@ADDON@_HDR  # list of header files

Example::

    LIB@ADDON@_SRC := $(DIR)/file1.cpp
    EXE@ADDON@_SRC := $(DIR)/run.cpp
    LIB@ADDON@_HDR := $(DIR)/file1.hpp

To configure and compile the addon run
::

    ./configure --with-addons=<addon>
    make

make compiles all source files and creates the addon library
``addons/<addon>/lib<addon>.a`` (including the object file ``file1.o`` in
the above example) and an executable (``addons/<addon>/run.x`` in the
above example).


Creating the source code documentation
--------------------------------------

FlexibleSUSY's source code documentation (including the generated
source code files) can be generated with Doxygen in HTML or man
format.  To generate the HTML documentation please run::

    make doc-html

The generated HTML index file can then be found in
``doc/html/index.html`` and can be viewed with any HTML browser, e.g.
::

    firefox doc/html/index.html

To generate the man documentation please run::

    make doc-man

The generated man pages can then be found in ``doc/man/man3/`` and can
be viewed as
::

    man doc/man/man3/model_file_options.3


Cleaning
--------

There are several make targets to remove generated files, compiled
object files, libraries or executables::

    make clean      # deletes all .d .o .a .x files

    make distclean  # does `clean` and `clean-generated`
                    # and deletes in addition:
                    # Makefile flexiblesusy-config config.*
                    # config/list_sarah_model_files.sh

    make clean-dep  # deletes all .d files

    make clean-executables # deletes all .x files

    make clean-generated   # deletes generated files

    make clean-lib  # deletes all libraries

    make clean-obj  # deletes all .o files

For each model ``<model>`` or addon there are specific clean targets
to remove model-specific files::

    make clean-<model>     # deletes .d .o .a .x files

    make distclean-<model> # same as `make clean-<model> clean-<model>-src`

    make clean-<model>-dep # deletes .d files

    make clean-<model>-lib # deletes model library

    make clean-<model>-obj # deletes .o files

    make clean-<model>-src # deletes generated files
