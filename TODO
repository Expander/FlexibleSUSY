List of features for future FlexibleSUSY releases
=================================================

MW predicition
--------------

The output value of MW should be taken from oneset, instead of the
model class.  Reason: The model class calculates MW at MSUSY, while
oneset calculates MW at MZ.


Explicit path to SARAH installation
-----------------------------------

Allow the user to specify full path to the SARAH installation
(suggested by Florian).  This will modify the Needs[] command used in
all the scripts (createmodel, configure, start.m).


Decays

ThetaW
------

Solve the ThetaW problem for models with multiple U(1) gauge groups.
Jae-hyeon's solution was:

 1. Use mass matrices for Photon, Z, W+ etc.  Do not make use of the
   already calculated analytic mass eigenvalues in
   UnrotatedParticles.m.

 2. Avoid replacing ZZ[1,1] -> Cos[ThetaW] etc. in SARAH.  This can be
   achieved by locally overwriting the SARAH`subAlways variable.  Here
   is Jae-hyeon's e-mail:

   Hi Alex,

   I am testing a workaround which prevents SARAH from parametrizing ZZ in
   terms of ThetaW.  I tried something like the following:
   
   someNPointFunctions =
     Cases[FlexibleSUSY`Private`nPointFunctions, 
      FSSelfEnergy[Fe[_, _][1], ___]];
   
   Select[
    Vertices`VertexRules[someNPointFunctions, 
     FlexibleSUSY`Private`Lat$massMatrices],
    ! FreeQ[#, VZ] &]
   
   => {Cp[bar[UFe[{gO2_}]], VZ, Fe[{gI2_}]][
      PR] -> -Sqrt[(3/5)] g1 Sin[ThetaW[]] ThetaStep[gI2, 3] ZER[gI2, 
       gO2], Cp[bar[UFe[{gO1_}]], VZ, Fe[{gI2_}]][
      PL] -> -I (1/
         2 I g2 conj[ZEL[gI2, gO1]] Cos[ThetaW[]] ThetaStep[gI2, 3] - 
        1/2 I Sqrt[3/5]
          g1 conj[ZEL[gI2, gO1]] Sin[ThetaW[]] ThetaStep[gI2, 3])}
   
   Select[
    Block[{SARAH`subAlways = 
       DeleteCases[SARAH`subAlways, HoldPattern[ZZ[_, _] :> _]]},
     Vertices`VertexRules[someNPointFunctions, 
      FlexibleSUSY`Private`Lat$massMatrices]
     ],
    ! FreeQ[#, VZ] &]
   
   => {Cp[bar[UFe[{gO2_}]], VZ, Fe[{gI2_}]][PR] -> 
     Sqrt[3/5] g1 ThetaStep[gI2, 3] ZER[gI2, gO2] ZZ[1, 2], 
    Cp[bar[UFe[{gO1_}]], VZ, Fe[{gI2_}]][
      PL] -> -I (1/2 I Sqrt[3/5]
          g1 conj[ZEL[gI2, gO1]] ThetaStep[gI2, 3] ZZ[1, 2] + 
        1/2 I g2 conj[ZEL[gI2, gO1]] ThetaStep[gI2, 3] ZZ[2, 2])}
   
   In the last result, the ZZ matrix elements remain.  IMO, this method is
   simpler and probably faster.  What do you think?

Parameter output names
----------------------

Currently we're creating the parametr output names from their
Mathematica symbols.  For example in the MSSM we convert

   \[Mu]    -->   "Mu"
   B[\[Mu]] -->   "BMu"

However, in SARAH the user can chose the output name in the model file
via

   {{  Description -> "Mu-parameter",
       LaTeX -> "\\mu",
       ...
       OutputName-> Mu }},

   {{  Description -> "Bmu-parameter",
       LaTeX -> "B_{\\mu}",
       ...
       OutputName-> Bmu }},

We should use the user-defined output name, i.e.

   \[Mu]    -->   "Mu"
   B[\[Mu]] -->   "Bmu"


Create a function which provides particle information
-----------------------------------------------------

Jae-hyeon proposed the following: FS could provide a function which
returns a list of (mass ordered) particles and their properies
(R-parity, Hypercharge, ...).  From this list a user can easily
extract for example the LSP (which would be the first particle in the
list with R-charge -1) or the weakly interacting particles etc.


Allow for complex parameters
----------------------------

This will allow to use CP-violating models as the MSSMCPV for example.


Allow to not run VEVs up to the GUT scale
-----------------------------------------

In the E6SSM for example the VEV running from MZ to MX can become
non-perturbative.  A user interface for disabling the running of some
parameters between some scales might be useful here.  Maybe like this:

  DisableRGRunning = {
      {vu, LowScale, HighScale},
      {vd, LowScale, HighScale}
  };
