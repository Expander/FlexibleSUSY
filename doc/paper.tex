  \begin{abstract}
   Here we introduce \fs, a MATHEMATICA package which generates a C++
   spectrum generator for any SUSY model, created with modularity and
   speed in mind.  \fs makes use of the existing \sarah package
   to obtain self energies, tadpoles corrections and renormalisation
   group equations in any model.  \fs then generates C++ code for
   calculating spectra with a structure that is designed to be
   flexible. The user specifies the model supplying the
   superpotential, gauge structure and particle content in a \sarah
   model file. The user should also specify the boundary conditions in
   a separate \fs model file. {\color{red}( Do we want to keep this
     separate and in different places, add a script to put a \sarah
     model file in the right place or combine them?)}  Flexible SUSY
   then translates these into C++ code along with numerical routines
   for solving the renormalisation group equations, one loop
   electroweak symmetry breaking conditions and a solver routine for
   simultaneously solving for the spectrum.  The modular structure of
   the generated code allows for any individual component to be
   replaced with an alternative if available.  Indeed \fs has been
   intentionally designed to grow as alternative solvers and
   calculators are added.

\section{Introduction}
Supersymmetry provides the only way to extend the space-time
symmetries of the poincar\'e group\cite{}, leading many to suspect
that it may be realised in nature in some form. In particular
supersymmetric extensions of the standard model where supersymmetry is
broken at the TeV scale have been proposed to solve the hierarchy
problem\cite{}, allow gauge coupling unification\cite{} and predict a
dark matter candidate\cite{} and can fit the observed relic
density\cite{}.  Such models have also been used for
baryogenesis\cite{} or leptogensis\cite{} to solve the
matter-anti-matter asymmetry of the universe and have been considered
as the low energy effective models originating from string
theory\cite{}.

Detailed phenonenological studies have been carried out for scenarios
with the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Many
computational tools have been created to aid these studies and to
explore the model. In particular there are a number of public spectrum
generators for MSSM\cite{Allanach:2001kg,Porod:2003um,Djouadi:2002ze,Baer:1993ae} and two for the NMSSM\cite{Ellwanger:2006rn,Allanach:nmssm} which allow
one to find the sparticle spectrum and mixings for a particular
choices of breaking mechanism inspired boundary conditions and
specified parameters.

However none of the fundamental motivations of supersymmetry require
minimality. Yet without minimality as a constraint, constructing
specialised tools to study all relevant models would require an
enormous amount of work.  So general tools which can automate this
process and produce fats and reliable programs can greatly enhance our
ability to understand and test non-minimal realisations of
supersymmetry.

From the recent $7$ TeV and $8$ TeV runs at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) there have been two important developments.  First low energy
signatures expected from such models, such as the classic jets plus
missing transverse energy signature, have not been observed,
substantially raising the lower limit on sparticle masses\cite{}. No
other signature of beyond the standard model(BSM) physics has been
observed, leaving the fundamental questions which motivated BSM
physics unanswered.

 Secondly ATLAS and CMS discovered\cite{} a light Higgs of $125$ GeV,
 within the mass range that could be accommodated in the MSSM but
 requiring stops which are significantly heavier than both the direct
 collider limits and indirect limits that appears in constrained
 models from the significantly higher limits on first and second
 generation squarks.  Alternatively it is possible that a $125$ GeV
 Higgs in non-minimal models may not require such heavy stops, indeed
 a number of such models have been constructed to do exactly this by
 having new tree level contributions to the Higgs mass.

These results lead to a number of different perspectives, for example
some may wish to abandon naturalness as a motivation and focus on BSM
models which can fit the observed relic density and allow unification
of gauge couplings, while others may focus on special models which
preserve naturalness.  In both cases exploration of the models can be
aided if it is possible to quickly create a spectrum generator to find
if there are phenomenologically viable scenarios in the models they
are interested and what the general features of such models are.

\subsection{The Program}
\fs is a MATHEMATICA package designed to create a fast and easily
adaptable spectrum generator in C++ for any SUSY model and some
non-supersymmetric models {\color{red} can we?}.  \fs makes use of the
existing \sarah package \cite{Staub:2010ty,Staub:2009bi,Staub:2010jh,Staub:2012pb,Staub:2013tta} to obtain one-loop self energies, one-loop
tadpoles corrections and two-loop renormalisation group
equations(RGEs) in any model.  \fs then converts these algerbraic
expressions from \sarah into C++ code using the C++11 standard. \fs
uses some parts of SOFTSUSY\cite{Allanach:2001kg}, the very fast Eigen
library \cite{eigen}, as well as the gnu scientific library and the
boost library to create numerical routines which then use these
routines to solve the RGEs and EWSB conditions which will be used in
the spectrum generator. The main solver routine of \fs then calls
these routines to find simultaneous solutions for the EWSB, low energy
data, and other, user supplied, boundary conditions (e.g. the usual
mSUGRA universality conditions) and calculates the mass spectrum.

 The modular structure of the generated code allows for any individual
 components to be replaced with an alternative if available.  Indeed
 \fs has been intentionally designed to grow as alternative solvers
 and calculators are added and a subsequent release with an
 alternative lattice solver is already planned.{\color{red} Or Indeed
   flexible SUSY is distributed with two different main solvers, the
   two-scale solver based on the approach of \cite{} and designed for
   speed and the a lattice solver designed to solve tricky cases where
   the fixed point iteration of the two-scale approach fails to
   converge.}  In addition if one already has an existing code for
 some other purpose and simply wishes to improve upon this by adding,
 e.g, new RGEs or self energies the modular fraework makes this fairly
 straightward{\color{red} Is this true?  because it should be...}


\subsection{Design goals}

FlexibleSUSY is designed with the following points in mind:

\paragraph{Speed}
Exploring the parameter space of supersymmetric models with a high
number of free parameters is quite time consuming.  Therefore
FlexibleSUSY aims to produce spectrum generators with a short run-time.

The two most time consuming parts of a spectrum generator are the
calculation of the beta functions and the pole masses for mixed
particles.

The reason is the following: The RG solving algorithms usually need
$O(10)$ iterations to calculate a particle spectrum with $0.1\%$
precision.  During each iteration the Runge--Kutta algorithm needs to
calculate all beta functions $O(50)$ times.  Most two-loop beta
functions involve $O(50)$ matrix multiplications and additions.  All
together one arrives at $O(2.5\cdot 10^4)$ matrix multiplications.  To
optimize these matrix multiplications FlexibleSUSY uses the fast
linear algebra package \href{Eigen}{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org}, which
exploits C++ expression templates to make the matrix multiplications
easy to write and optimize.

The second most time consuming part is the precise calculation of the
pole masses for mixed particles.  For each particle $\psi_i$ the full
self-energy matrix $\Sigma^\psi_{ij}(p=m^\text{tree}_{\psi_i})$ has to
be evaluated.  Each self-energy matrix entry again involves the
evaluation of $O(50)$ Feynman diagrams, which involves the calculation
of vertices and loop functions.  All in all, one arrives at $O(500)$
Feynman diagram or $O(3\cdot 10^4)$ loop function evaluations.  To
speed up the calculation of the pole masses FlexibleSUSY makes use of
multi-threading, where each pole mass is calculated in a separate
thread.  By this technique one can gain a speed-up of $20$--$30\%$.

\paragraph{Modularity}
The large variety of supersymmetric models makes it likely that the
user needs to modify the generated spectrum generator source code.
FlexibleSUSY uses object orientation with C++ to modularize the source
code to make it easy for the user to modify and extend the spectrum
generator.  An important application here are the constraints: The RG
solvers provide a constraint interface,

%
which can be implemented to create the custom constraint
\code{MyConstraint}.  In the \code{apply()} function the constraint
application takes place and the \code{get_scale()} function specifies
the scale at which the constraint is to be applied.

For example in the MSSM by default \fs adds two loop Higgs FORTRAN routines supplied by P.~Slavich from \cite{slavich-degrassi} to add two loop corrections of $\oatas$, $\oabas$, $\oatq$, $\oabatau$, 
$\oabq$, $\oatauq$ and $\oatab$  as follows...

\subsection{two scale fixed point iteration}
The default solver which calls the above routines above and finds the full set of $\overline{DR}$ masses in the model consistent with all constraints is the two-scale solver.  This can be selected by... but if no selection is made this will be used anyway as default. 

This approach is decribed in \cite{Barger:1993gh} for the MSSM and is widely implemented in SUSY spectrum generators.

\subsection{pole masses}
With the solver routine finished and convergence achieved, the $\overline{DR}$ parameters consistent with one loop EWSB, low energy data and all user supplied boundary conditions are then known at any scale between...

The physical mass spectrum can now be calculated.  \fs uses the full one-loop self energies and tree level routines to calculate the pole masses at the one-level.  If higher accuracy is required additional routines with higher order corrections can be added in a very simple way. For example in the MSSM by default \fs adds two loop Higgs FORTRAN routines supplied by P.~Slavich from \cite{slavich-degrassi} to add two loop corrections of $\oatas$, $\oabas$, $\oatq$, $\oabatau$, 
$\oabq$, $\oatauq$ and $\oatab$  as follows...  
Something similar is done for the NMSSM, but in this case the NMSSM $\oatas$, $\oabas$ pieces come from \cite{Degrassi:2009yq}, while for $\oatq$, $\oabatau$, 
$\oabq$, $\oatauq$ and $\oatab$ the MSSM pieces are used though it should be understood that these are not complete in the NMSSM. For other models since the Higgs mass is a very important measurement and the two loop corrections can be larger than the current experimental error \cite{Degrassi:2009yq} we recommend that the leading log two loop corrections are estimated, by generalising those of the MSSM or NMSSM, as has been done, for example, in the E$_6$SSM\cite{King:2005jy}. 

Corrections to other masses or further corrections to the Higgs states can be added very easily by...

    {SHu0, {vu, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmau, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiu,1/Sqrt[2]}},
    {SsR,  {vs, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmaS, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiS,1/Sqrt[2]}}
};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Add new VEV
\begin{lstlisting} 
  DEFINITION[EWSB][VEVs]= 
  { {SHd0, {vd, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmad, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phid,1/Sqrt[2]}},
    {SHu0, {vu, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmau, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiu,1/Sqrt[2]}},
    {SsR,  {vs, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmaS, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiS,1/Sqrt[2]}}
};
\end{lstlisting}
\item  Add the singlino to the list of gauge eigenstate dirac fermions
\begin{lstlisting}
  DEFINITION[GaugeES][DiracSpinors]={
  Bino ->{fB, conj[fB]},
  Wino -> {fWB, conj[fWB]},
  Glu -> {fG, conj[fG]},
  H0 -> {FHd0, conj[FHu0]},
  HC -> {FHdm, conj[FHup]},
  Fd1 -> {FdL, 0},
  Fd2 -> {0, FdR},
  Fu1 -> {FuL, 0},
  Fu2 -> {0, FuR},
  Fe1 -> {FeL, 0},
  Fe2 -> {0, FeR},
  Fv -> {FvL,0}
  FS -> {FsR,conj[FsR]}   
};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Edit mass eigenstates to give how the gauge eigenstates mix into mass eigenstates.  Here we add to the cp even higgs a real singlet, to the CP odd the imaginary part of the singlet and finally to the neutralinos we add the singlino.

\begin{lstlisting}
 DEFINITION[EWSB][MatterSector]= 
{    {{SdL, SdR}, {Sd, ZD}},
     {{SvL}, {Sv, ZV}},
     {{SuL, SuR}, {Su, ZU}},
     {{SeL, SeR}, {Se, ZE}},
     {{phid, phiu, phiS}, {hh, ZH}},       <----------------
     {{sigmad, sigmau, sigmaS}, {Ah, ZA}}, <----------------
     {{SHdm,conj[SHup]},{Hpm,ZP}},
     {{fB, fW0, FHd0, FHu0, FsR}, {L0, ZN}}, <---------------
     {{{fWm, FHdm}, {fWp, FHup}}, {{Lm,UM}, {Lp,UP}}},
     {{{FeL},{conj[FeR]}},{{FEL,ZEL},{FER,ZER}}},
     {{{FdL},{conj[FdR]}},{{FDL,ZDL},{FDR,ZDR}}},
     {{{FuL},{conj[FuR]}},{{FUL,ZUL},{FUR,ZUR}}}       }; 

\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
\item Now we copy over particles.m \code{cp /path/to/SARAH/Models/MSSM/particles.m  ./}
\item Edit particles.m as follows
\begin{enumerate}  
\item First we add to particleDefinitions[GaugeES]:
\begin{lstlisting}
 ParticleDefinitions[GaugeES] = {
      {SdL,  { Description -> "Left Down-Squarks"}},
      {SdR,  { Description -> "Right Down-Squarks"}},
      ...........
      ...........
      ...........
      {H0,   { Description -> "Neutral Higgsinos"}},
      {HC,   { Description -> "Charged Higgsinos"}},
      {SsR, { Description -> "Singlet"}},         <---------------
      {FS,   { Description -> "Singlino" }},      <---------------
      {Fd1,  { Description -> "Dirac Left Down-Quark"}},
      {Fd2,  { Description -> "Dirac Right Down-Quark"}},
      ............
      ............
      };
\end{lstlisting}
Note that we are brief in information here becasue there is already some information contained in the default particles.m file in the model directory:
\begin{lstlisting} 
{{ Description -> "Singlet", 
                 PDG -> {0},
                 PDG.IX -> 0,
                 Width -> 0, 
                 Mass -> Automatic,
                 FeynArtsNr -> 98,
                 LaTeX -> "S",
                 OutputName -> "s"

    }},    
   
   
(* -------- Weyl Spinor  ------ *)   
    
  {{ Description -> "Weyl Spinor of Singlino", 
                 PDG -> 99,
                 Width -> 0, 
                 Mass -> Automatic,
                 FeynArtsNr -> 9,
                 LaTeX -> "\\tilde{S}",
                 OutputName -> "s"

    }},  

\end{lstlisting}
 \item Now we edit ParticleDefinitions[EWSB].  Again most states are defined in brief form by a name because they use the default information in the particles.m in the models directory.  But here we need to over write some of the default options for the cp even and cp odd higgs states: 
\begin{lstlisting}
 {hh   ,  {  Description -> "Higgs", 
                 PDG -> {25, 35,45},
                 PDG.IX ->{101000001,101000002,101000003}
 }}, 
       {Ah   ,  {    Description -> "Pseudo-Scalar Higgs",
                 PDG -> {0, 36, 46},
                 PDG.IX ->{0,102000001,102000002  } }}, 

\end{lstlisting}
\item To the WeylFermionAndIndermediate we add the Weyl singlino and the real scalar singlet field and imaginary scalar singlet field:  
 \begin{lstlisting}
  {sigmaS,      {Description -> "Scalar Singlet" }}  ,
  {phiS,      { Description -> "Pseudo Scalar Singlet"}},
  {FsR,   { Description -> "Weyl Spinor of Singlino"}},
 \end{lstlisting}
 
Although the WeylFermionAndIndermediate also contains, 
\begin{lstlisting}
{SHd,  { Description -> "Down-Higgs"}},
       {SHu,  { Description -> "Up-Higgs"}},
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent we do not add a singlet version becasue for the singlet there is no distinction between these and the individual SU(2) components, as there are for Hu and Hd.
\end{enumerate} 
\item Now we copy over parameters.m \code{cp /path/to/SARAH/Models/MSSM/parameters.m  ./}
\item Add the new parameters lambda, kappa, Alambda and Akappa to the list.
\begin{lstlisting}
{\[Kappa],   {Description -> "Singlet Self-Interaction"}},              
{T[\[Kappa]],  { Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet Self-Interaction" }}, 
{\[Lambda],   { Description -> "Singlet-Higgs-Interaction"   }},
{T[\[Lambda]],  {Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet-Higgs-Interaction"}}, 
{ms2,       { Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet Mass" }},
{vS,        { Description -> "Singlet-VEV"}}       
\end{lstlisting}
Once again this is simplified from the general case becasue there are default versions containedin parameters.m in the Models directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
{{  Description -> "Singlet Self-Interaction",
              LaTeX -> "\\kappa",
             Real ->False,
             Dependence -> None, 
             Value -> None, 
             LesHouches -> {NMSSMRUN,2},
             OutputName-> kap         }},                               
               
{{ Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet Self-Interaction",
               LaTeX -> "T_{\\kappa}",
              Real -> False,
             Dependence -> None, 
             Value -> None, 
             LesHouches ->{NMSSMRUN,4},
             OutputName-> Tk         }}, 

 {{ Description -> "Singlet-Higgs-Interaction",
             LaTeX -> "\\lambda",
             Real -> False,
	     Dependence -> None, 
             Value -> None, 
             LesHouches -> {NMSSMRUN,1},
             OutputName-> lam          }},                               
               
{{Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet-Higgs-Interaction",
                LaTeX -> "T_{\\lambda}",
              Real -> False,
             Dependence -> None, 
             Value -> None, 
             LesHouches ->{NMSSMRUN,3},
             OutputName-> Tlam         }},    
{{ Description -> "Softbreaking Singlet Mass", 
              LaTeX -> "m_S^2",
             DependenceNum ->  None, 
             LesHouches -> {NMSSMRUN,10},
             OutputName-> ms2 }},
              
{{ Description -> "Singlet-VEV", 
			 LaTeX -> "v_s",
             Value -> None, 
             LesHouches -> {NMSSMRUN,5},
             OutputName-> vS         }},
\end{lstlisting}
\item Navigate to Flexible SUSY directory  \code{cd /path/to/FlexibleSUSY/}
\item Create Z3NMSSM directory 
\begin{lstlisting}
./createmodel --models=Z3NMSSM:myNMSSM
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}   
\subsection{\ESSM}
Detailed steps to create \ESSM model file.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create new directory \code{mkdir myE6SSM}
\item Move into this new directory \code{cd myE6SSM}
\item copy the MSSM model file in \code{cp /path/to/SARAH/Models/MSSM/MSSM.m  myE6SSM.m}
\item Edit myE6SSM.m as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Change Model name, author and date
\item Modify MSSM superfield definitions to include new charges.
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperFields[[1]] = {q, 3, {uL,  dL},     1/6, 2, 3, Qq, RpM};  
SuperFields[[2]] = {l, 3, {vL,  eL},    -1/2, 2, 1, Ql, RpM};
SuperFields[[3]] = {Hd,1, {Hd0, Hdm},   -1/2, 2, 1, QHd, RpP};
SuperFields[[4]] = {Hu,1, {Hup, Hu0},    1/2, 2, 1, QHu, RpP};
SuperFields[[5]] = {d, 3, conj[dR],    1/3, 1, -3, Qd, RpM};
SuperFields[[6]] = {u, 3, conj[uR],   -2/3, 1, -3, Qu, RpM};
SuperFields[[7]] = {e, 3, conj[eR],      1, 1,  1, Qe, RpM};
\end{lstlisting}
Note that in the \ESSM model the charges are fixed to be those of the $U(1)_N$ as shown in e.g. \cite{King:2005jy}.  However here we leave the charges unassigned at the Mathematica level, and will set them as parameters in the C++ code.  The charges could also simply be fixed here to simplify the C++ code.

\item Add Singlet Higgs superfield to SuperFields
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperFields[[8]] = {s, 1, sR,     0, 1,  1, Qs, RpP};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Add inert Higgs-like superfields 
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperFields[[9]] = {H1I, 2, {H1I0, H1Im},  -1/2, 2, 1, QHu, RpP};
SuperFields[[10]] = {H2I, 2, {H2Ip, H2I0},   1/2, 2, 1, QHd, RpP};
SuperFields[[11]] = {sI, 2, sR,    0, 1,  1, Qs, RpM};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Add exotics to SuperFields
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperFields[[12]] = {Dx, 3, conj[DxR],  1/3, 1, -3, QDx, RpP};
SuperFields[[13]] = {Dxbar, 3, conj[DxbarR],  -1/3, 1, 3, QDxbar, RpP};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Add additional survival $SU(2)$ multiplets to SuperFields
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperFields[[14]] = {Hp, 1, conj[HpR],    0.5, 2,  1, QHp, RpP};
SuperFields[[15]] = {Hpbar, 1, conj[HpbarR],    -0.5, 2,  1, QHpbar, RpP};
\end{lstlisting}
\item Modify superpotential
\begin{lstlisting}
SuperPotential = Yu u.q.Hu - Yd d.q.Hd - Ye e.l.Hd + \[Lambda] S.Hu.Hd +  La S.H2I.H1I + \[Kappa] S.Dx.Dxbar;
\end{lstlisting}
\item Add new VEV
\begin{lstlisting} DEFINITION[EWSB][VEVs]= 
  { {SHd0, {vd, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmad, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phid,1/Sqrt[2]}},
    {SHu0, {vu, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmau, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiu,1/Sqrt[2]}},
    {SsR,  {vs, 1/Sqrt[2]}, {sigmaS, \[ImaginaryI]/Sqrt[2]},{phiS,1/Sqrt[2]}}
};
\end{lstlisting}


\end{enumerate}  
 
\end{enumerate}   
\section{Tests}
