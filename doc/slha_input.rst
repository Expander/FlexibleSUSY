**Description**:

The ``FlexibleSUSY`` block contains fields to configure the spectrum
calculation at run-time.  For example, in the ``FlexibleSUSY`` block the
renormalization group running precsision, the beta function loop order
or the loop order of the pole mass calculation can be selected.

Precision goal (``FlexibleSUSY[0]``)
````````````````````````````````````

FlexibleSUSY solves the given boundary value problem (BVP) by running
all model parameters to each scale and imposing the corresponding
boundary conditions until a convergent solution has been found or the
maximum number of iterations has been reached.  In ``FlexibleSUSY[0]``,
precision goal of the BVP solver can be specified.  The precision goal
determines

- the precision of the numerical solution of the RGEs,

- the precision of the numerical solution of the EWSB equations and

- to test whether the BVP solver has found a convergent solution.


Maximum number of iterations (``FlexibleSUSY[1]``)
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

FlexibleSUSY solves the given boundary value problem (BVP) by running
to each scale and imposing the corresponding boundary conditions until
a convergent solution has been found or the maximum number of
iterations, :math:`N_{\text{max.it.}}`, has been reached.  In
``FlexibleSUSY[1]``, the maximum number of iterations
:math:`N_{\text{max.it.}}` used to solve the BVP can be specified.  If
:math:`N_{\text{max.it.}}` is set to ``0``, the maximum number of
iterations is set to :math:`N_{\text{max.it.}} = -10 \log_{10}(p),`
where :math:`p` is the precision goal specified in
``FlexibleSUSY[0]``.

BVP solver (``FlexibleSUSY[2]``)
````````````````````````````````

Choses the boundary value problem (BVP) solver: 0 = all that are
enabled (starting with the two-scale solver, if present), 1 =
two-scale solver (if present), 2 = semi-analytic solver (if present).

Calculate pole masses of Standard Model particles (``FlexibleSUSY[3]``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Calculate pole masses of Standard Model particles: 0 = do not
calculate Standard Model pole masses, 1 = calculate the Standard Model
pole masses.

Pole mass loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[4]``)
``````````````````````````````````````````

Maximum pole mass loop order.  0 = tree-level, 1 = 1-loop, 2 = 2-loop
(if available), 3 = 3-loop (if available).

EWSB loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[5]``)
`````````````````````````````````````

Maximum loop order of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)
equations.  0 = tree-level, 1 = 1-loop, 2 = 2-loop (if available), 3 =
3-loop (if available).

.. important:: The EWSB loop order should always be set to the same
               value as the pole mass loop order!

beta-function loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[6]``)
``````````````````````````````````````````````

Loop order of the renormalization group running.  0 = no running, 1 =
1-loop running, 2 = 2-loop running, 3 = 3-loop running (if available),
etc.

Threshold correction loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[7]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Using the flag ``FlexibleSUSY[7]`` the "global" loop order of the
threshold corrections of the SM to the full BSM model can be selected.
The threshold corrections affect the determination of the running BSM
model parameters :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}`, :math:`\alpha_s`,
:math:`\sin(\theta_W)`, :math:`y_e`, :math:`y_\mu`, :math:`y_\tau`,
:math:`y_b`, :math:`y_t`, :math:`v` at the low-energy scale
:math:`Q_{\text{low}}` in the :math:`\overline{\text{MS}}` or
:math:`\overline{\text{DR}}` scheme.

.. note:: The individual loop orders of the threshold corrections can
          be specified using ``FlexibleSUSY[24]``.

- :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold
  correction loop order is set to ``0``,
  :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}(Q_{\text{low}})` is set to
  :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}^{\text{SM}(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})` in the
  Standard Model with 5 active quark flavours.  If the threshold
  correction loop order is set to ``1``,
  :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}(Q_{\text{low}})` is calculated from
  :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}^{\text{SM}(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})` using the
  full 1-loop threshold correction.

- :math:`\alpha_s(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold correction loop
  order is set to ``0``, :math:`\alpha_s(Q_{\text{low}})` is set to
  :math:`\alpha_s^{\text{SM}(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})` in the Standard
  Model with 5 active quark flavours.  If the threshold correction
  loop order is set to ``1``, :math:`\alpha_s(Q_{\text{low}})` is
  calculated from :math:`\alpha_s^{\text{SM}(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})`
  using the full 1-loop threshold correction.

- :math:`\sin(\theta_W)(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold correction
  loop order is set to ``0``, the weak mixing angle is calculated from
  either (i) :math:`\{G_F,M_Z\}` or (ii) :math:`\{M_W,M_Z\}`
  (depending on the choice of the weak mixing angle calculation in the
  FlexibleSUSY model file, see `FlexibleSUSY model file`_) using the
  corresponding tree-level relation.

  If the threshold correction loop order is set to ``1``, the the weak
  mixing angle is calculated at the 1-loop level, taking into account

  - (i): complete 1-loop corrections to the W and Z self-energies
    :math:`\Pi_{ZZ}^T, \Pi_{ZZ}^T` as well as 1-loop corrections to
    :math:`\Delta r`, which includes vertex and box contributions
    :math:`\delta_{\text{VG}}` from neutralinos, charginos, selectrons
    and smuons.

  - (ii): complete 1-loop corrections to the W and Z self-energies
    :math:`\Pi_{ZZ}^T, \Pi_{ZZ}^T`.

  If the threshold correction loop order is set to ``2``, the weak
  mixing angle is calculated at the 1-loop level, as above, and the
  following 2-loop correction is taken into account:

  - (i): 2-loop corrections to :math:`\Delta r` of the order
    :math:`O(\alpha_{\text{em}} \alpha_s + y_t^4)` from
    [hep-ph:9606211]_ Eqs. (C.5)-(C.6).

- :math:`y_e(Q_{\text{low}})`, :math:`y_\mu(Q_{\text{low}})`,
  :math:`y_\tau(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold correction loop order
  is set to ``0``, the lepton Yukawa couplings
  :math:`y_e(Q_{\text{low}})`, :math:`y_\mu(Q_{\text{low}})`,
  :math:`y_\tau(Q_{\text{low}})` are calculated from the lepton pole
  masses in the Standard Model with 5 active quark flavours using the
  tree-level relation.

  If the threshold correction loop order is set to ``1``,
  :math:`y_e(Q_{\text{low}})`, :math:`y_\mu(Q_{\text{low}})`,
  :math:`y_\tau(Q_{\text{low}})` are calculated at the scale
  :math:`Q_{\text{low}}` at the 1-loop level from the running lepton
  masses in Standard Model with 5 active quark flavours.

- :math:`y_b(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold correction loop order is
  set to ``0``, the bottom Yukawa couplings :math:`y_b(Q_{\text{low}})` is
  calculated from the running bottom mass in the Standard Model with 5
  active quark flavours, :math:`m_b^{(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})`, using the
  tree-level relation.

  If the threshold correction loop order is set to ``1``,
  :math:`y_b(Q_{\text{low}})` is calculated at the scale
  :math:`Q_{\text{low}}` from :math:`m_b^{(5)}(Q_{\text{low}})` taking the
  complete 1-loop correction into account.

- :math:`y_t(Q_{\text{low}})`: If the threshold correction loop order is
  set to ``0``, the running top Yukawa coupling
  :math:`y_t(Q_{\text{low}})` is calculated from the top pole mass,
  :math:`M_t`, using the tree-level relation.

  If the threshold correction loop order is set to ``1``, the running
  :math:`y_t(Q_{\text{low}})` is calculated at the scale
  :math:`Q_{\text{low}}` from :math:`M_t` taking the complete 1-loop
  correction into account.

  where :math:`\Sigma_{t}^{S}(p)`, :math:`\Sigma_{t}^{L}(p)`,
  :math:`\Sigma_{t}^{R}(p)` denote the scalar, left- and right-handed

2-loop Higgs pole mass contributions (``FlexibleSUSY[8-11]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Selects (on/off = 1/0) the individual 2-loop Higgs pole mass
contributions (if available).

Force output (``FlexibleSUSY[12]``)
```````````````````````````````````

If set to 1, an output is always printed, even if a problem has
occurred during the calculation.

.. WARNING:: Be careful with this option!  Check the problems and
             warnings that have occurred!

Top pole mass loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[13]``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````

Loop order of contributions to the top pole mass.  0 = full 1-loop, 1
= 2-loop QCD, 2 = 3-loop QCD.

.. note:: The top pole mass is only calculated if ``FlexibleSUSY[3] = 1``.

Beta-function zero threshold (``FlexibleSUSY[14]``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Below this threshold, beta-functions are treated as being exactly
zero.  Setting this threshold to a non-zero value can avoid numerical
problems / non-convergence problems in models with complex parameters.

Calculate observables (``FlexibleSUSY[15]``)
````````````````````````````````````````````

Enable/disable (1/0) the calculation of the observables specified in
the FlexibleSUSY model file.  See the section on observables in
`FlexibleSUSY model file`_ for further details about how to select the
calculation of observables in FlexibleSUSY.

Force positive Majorana masses (``FlexibleSUSY[16]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If set to 1, the masses of Majorana fermions will always be positive.
In this case, the corresponding mixing matrices may be complex.

.. WARNING:: Setting ``FlexibleSUSY[6] = 1`` violates the SLHA standard.

Pole mass scale (``FlexibleSUSY[17]``)
``````````````````````````````````````

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[17]``, the renormalization scale at which the
pole mass spectrum is calculated can be overwritten.  By default the
renormalization scale is the SUSY scale (``SUSYScale`` variable in the
model file).  If ``FlexibleSUSY[17]`` is set to ``0``, the value given
by the ``SUSYScale`` variable is used.  If ``FlexibleSUSY[17]`` is set
to a non-zero value, then this value is used as renormalization scale.

EFT pole mass scale (``FlexibleSUSY[18]``)
``````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Only used if ``FlexibleEFTHiggs == True``

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[18]``, the renormalization scale at which the
Standard Model pole mass spectrum is calculated in the EFT can be
overwritten.  If unspecified or set to ``0``, the minimum of the top
pole mass and the ``SUSYScale`` is used.

EFT matching scale (``FlexibleSUSY[19]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Only used if ``FlexibleEFTHiggs == True``

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[19]``, the renormalization scale at which the full
model is matched to the Standard Model can be overwritten.  If
unspecified or set to ``0``, the ``SUSYScale`` is used.

EFT upwards matching loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[20]``)
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Only used if ``FlexibleEFTHiggs == True``

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[20]``, the loop order for the matching of the
Standard Model to the full BSM model can be selected ("upwards
matching").  If unspecified, the loop order is set to ``2``.

EFT downwards matching loop order (``FlexibleSUSY[21]``)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Only used if ``FlexibleEFTHiggs == True``

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[21]``, the loop order for the matching of the BSM
model to the Standard Model can be selected ("downwards matching").
If unspecified, the loop order is set to ``1``.

EFT index of SM-like Higgs (``FlexibleSUSY[22]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Only used if ``FlexibleEFTHiggs == True``

Using ``FlexibleSUSY[22]``, the user can specify which Higgs in the BSM
model should be interpreted to be the SM-like one.  If unspecified,
the index is set to ``0``, i.e. the lightest Higgs eigenstate in the BSM
model is interpreted as the SM-like Higgs.

Calculate pole masses of BSM particles (``FlexibleSUSY[23]``)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Enable/disable (1/0) the calculation of the pole masses of
non-Standard Model particles.

Individual threshold corrections (``FlexibleSUSY[24]``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The entry ``FlexibleSUSY[24]`` can be used for a fine-grained control to
specify the loop orders of the low-energy threshold corrections of the
SM(5) parameters to the parameters of the BSM model.  The given number
is composed of several digits, each one specifying a threshold
correction loop order of a parameter.  The following table shows which
digit is associated with which parameter.

========================== =========================================== ===========================
 digit position :math:`n`   default value (prefactor of :math:`10^n`)   parameter
========================== =========================================== ===========================
 0                          1 (1-loop)                                  :math:`\alpha_{\text{em}}`
 1                          2 (2-loop)                                  :math:`\sin\theta_W`
 2                          3 (3-loop)                                  :math:`\alpha_{s}`
 3                          1 (1-loop)                                  :math:`m_Z`
 4                          1 (1-loop)                                  :math:`m_W`

 6                          3 (3-loop)                                  :math:`m_t`
 7                          2 (2-loop)                                  :math:`m_b`
 8                          1 (1-loop)                                  :math:`m_{\tau}`
========================== =========================================== ===========================

Note, that the threshold correction loop order of a parameter is not
higher than the "global" threshold correction loop order, specified by
``FlexibleSUSY[7]``.

3-loop corrections to the Higgs pole mass (``FlexibleSUSY[25-29]``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In the MSSM, the 3-loop corrections to the Higgs pole mass of the
order :math:`O(\alpha_t \alpha_s^2 + \alpha_b \alpha_s^2)`
[1005.5709]_ can be taken into account.  To include them, the variable
``UseHiggs3LoopMSSM`` must be set to ``True`` in the model file::

    UseHiggs3LoopMSSM = True;

.. important:: It is strongly recommended to also set ``UseMSSMYukawa2Loop = True;`` and ``UseMSSM3LoopRGEs = True;`` for consistency.

To enable the 3-loop corrections at run-time in general, set both
``FlexibleSUSY[4]`` and ``FlexibleSUSY[5]`` to ``3``.  To enable the
specific :math:`O(\alpha_t \alpha_s^2)` correction at run-time, set the
flag ``FlexibleSUSY[26]`` to ``1``.  To enable the 3-loop correction
:math:`O(\alpha_b \alpha_s^2)` at run-time, set the flag
``FlexibleSUSY[27]`` to ``1``.

The 3-loop corrections from [1005.5709]_ can be calculated in the
:math:`\overline{DR}'`, :math:`\overline{MDR}'` or H3m scheme.  To use
the :math:`\overline{DR}'` scheme, set ``FlexibleSUSY[25]`` to ``0``.
To use the :math:`\overline{MDR}'` scheme, set ``FlexibleSUSY[25]`` to
``1``.  To use the H3m scheme, set ``FlexibleSUSY[25]`` to ``2``.

We recommend to set the following model file options to enable the
3-loop Higgs pole mass corrections in the MSSM::

    UseHiggs2LoopMSSM = True;      (* enable 2-loop corrections *)
    EffectiveMu = \[Mu];           (* sign convention for MSSM mu parameter *)
    UseMSSM3LoopRGEs = True;       (* enable 3-loop RGEs *)
    UseHiggs3LoopMSSM = True;      (* enable 3-loop corrections *)
    UseMSSMYukawa2Loop = True;     (* enable 2-loop SQCD corrections to yt and yb *)
    UseMSSMAlphaS2Loop = True;     (* enable 2-loop SQCD corrections to alpha_s *)

To run FlexibleSUSY with the 3-loop corrections, we recommend the
settings in the SLHA input::

    Block FlexibleSUSY
        4   3                    # pole mass loop order
        5   3                    # EWSB loop order
        6   3                    # beta-functions loop order
        7   2                    # threshold corrections loop order
        8   1                    # Higgs 2-loop corrections O(alpha_t alpha_s)
        9   1                    # Higgs 2-loop corrections O(alpha_b alpha_s)
       10   1                    # Higgs 2-loop corrections O((alpha_t + alpha_b)^2)
       11   1                    # Higgs 2-loop corrections O(alpha_tau^2)
       24   123111221            # individual threshold correction loop orders
       25   0                    # ren. scheme for Higgs 3L corrections (0 = DR', 1 = MDR', 2 = H3m)
       26   1                    # Higgs 3-loop corrections O(alpha_t alpha_s^2)
       27   1                    # Higgs 3-loop corrections O(alpha_b alpha_s^2)
       28   1                    # Higgs 3-loop corrections O(alpha_t^2 alpha_s)
       29   1                    # Higgs 3-loop corrections O(alpha_t^3)
       30   1                    # Higgs 4-loop corrections O(alpha_t alpha_s^3)

In FlexibleSUSY's Mathematica interface, the following settings should
be used::

    fsSettings -> {
        poleMassLoopOrder -> 3,            (* FlexibleSUSY[4] *)
        ewsbLoopOrder -> 3,                (* FlexibleSUSY[5] *)
        betaFunctionLoopOrder -> 3,        (* FlexibleSUSY[6] *)
        thresholdCorrectionsLoopOrder -> 2,(* FlexibleSUSY[7] *)
        higgs2loopCorrectionAtAs -> 1,     (* FlexibleSUSY[8] *)
        higgs2loopCorrectionAbAs -> 1,     (* FlexibleSUSY[9] *)
        higgs2loopCorrectionAtAt -> 1,     (* FlexibleSUSY[10] *)
        higgs2loopCorrectionAtauAtau -> 1, (* FlexibleSUSY[11] *)
        thresholdCorrections -> 123111221, (* FlexibleSUSY[24] *)
        higgs3loopCorrectionRenScheme -> 0,(* FlexibleSUSY[25] *)
        higgs3loopCorrectionAtAsAs -> 1,   (* FlexibleSUSY[26] *)
        higgs3loopCorrectionAbAsAs -> 1,   (* FlexibleSUSY[27] *)
    }

.. note:: In [1708.05720]_ the individual threshold corrections
          (``FlexibleSUSY[24]``, ``thresholdCorrections``) were set to
          ``123111121``, i.e. the 2-loop SQCD threshold corrections to
          :math:`\alpha_s(M_Z)` have not been taken into account for
          clarity, because they would correspond to a partial 4-loop
          contribution to the light CP-even Higgs pole mass.
