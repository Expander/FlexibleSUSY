FLEXIBLE FUTURE 
list of planned or possible future extensions, fixes, collaborations 
and applications. 

Planned major extensions:

 * FlexibleDecay - calcuating higgs and sparticle decays

 * FlexibleBSM - including non-supersymmetric models (may not be that difficult)

 * Lattice method - new method for solving boundary value problem.

 * Complex parameters - extending to complex parameters
 
 * semi-anaylic solver - method for solving boundary value problem used 
                         by CE6SSMSpecGen

 * Leading two loop mh calculator.    			 

And Fixes / minor extensions:

* Weinberg angle issues: fix using the approach suggested by Jae-hyeon.

* create modified two scale algorithm where variables fixed at the low scale 
  have vlaues saved at the SUSY scale on the run up, to improve stability.

* a modification to two scale algorithm where negative scalar squared
  masses that can appear at an intermediate stage are used untouched
  in self-energies/tadpoles.  For this, one may use complex-valued
  loop functions from fflite that accept negative squared masses.

* E6SSM model issues in Hp coupling discussed with Florian Staub, 
  may need fix from FlexibleSUSY

* Provide abstract interface class with getters and setters for spectrum?
  There is a prototype of this being created for gambit 

* Provide methods which pass the spectum as a model object and/or slhaea object?
  ~Prototype GetSpec class can be found in:
  https://github.com/pathron/higgs-decays-NE6SSM 
  (see NE6SSM-SpecGen/models/NE6SSM/GetScale.hpp)

* Add explicit getters for goldstones and physical Higgs states 
  with goldstones removed.  Latter may cause confusion with get_MAh
  though. 
  
* Automatic one-loop muon decay calculation.  Use to get MW as prediction.

* make getters and setters safer? (currently incorrect acces returns
                                  eigen error at run time)

* provide better scanning routines?

* Any more?

  

Planned Collaborations:

* FlexibleSUSY with Flavorkit: http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1434 
  (A. Voigt and F. Staub?).

* FlexibleSUSY in GAMBIT (P.Athron + rest of GAMBIT)

* What about other codes, learning how to link to relic density calculators
  maybe?

* Possibly Alex will work with Master Code collaboration?

* Link with Fittino.

Planned applications:

* Study of Higgs decays in E6SSM custodial symmetry like models where the 
  ZPrime mass split from the sfermions masses by a special mechanism.
  Stutus: well under way, should be finished this summer. 
   Collaborators:  P.Athron, M.Muehlleitner R.Nevzorov, A.G.Williams

* Follow up on constrained versions of these models and Dark matter
  Collaborators:  P.Athron, D.Harries, R.Nevzorov, A.G.Williams

* EZSSM dark matter direct detection study, uses FlexibleSUSY generated RGES 
  created from in develoipment version.
  Status: hopefully finished this summer.
  Collaborators:  P.Athron, A.T.Thomas, S.Underwood, M.White	
  
* Z' fine tuning. Now uses some RGEs FlexibleSUSY for U(1) extended models.  
  Project well under way. Talk at SUSY 2014.  Paper soon after. 
  Collaborators:  P.Athron, D.Harries, A.G.Williams

* MRSSM study
  Collaborators: P.Diessner, D. Stoeckinger ?
